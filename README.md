## The following tags were used in the code
(0x0020, 0x0032) Image Position (Patient) (x, y z coordinates for the upper-left corner)
(0x0020, 0x0037) Image Orientation (Patient) (Direction of cosines of the first row and the first column)
(0x0028, 0x0010) Number of Rows
(0x0028, 0x0011) Number of Columns
(0x0028, 0x0030) Pixel Spacing (x, y) - physical distance between pixel centres, [row spacing, column spacing]
(0x0028, 0x1052) Rescale Intercept - b in Output units = m*SV+b
(0x0028, 0x1053) Rescale Slope - m in Output units = m*SV+b
(0x7FE0, 0x0010) Pixel Data (always loaded in at the end)
(0x0018, 0x0050) Slice Thickness
